## About Me

## Growth Mindset
A commitment to the idea that your potential is not limited, that we have the capacity to develop and grow through learning. Challenges and setbacks can be overcome and used to learn rather than internalised as proof of something negative in yourself.
### How I can keep myself in a growth mindset:
* Review things at the end of the day or the next day, to have a more objective view
* View others success and progress as inspiration, & don't be afraid of constructive criticism
* Allow yourself to take breaks to replenish your energy and get unstuck
